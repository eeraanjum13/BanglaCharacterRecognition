# BanglaCharacterRecognition
Bangla Character Recognition using Perceptron, MLP, RNN and CNN
MLP WOrks fine. Perceptron doesn't, obviously.
CNN and RNN are working but CNN has shown overfitting so more refinement is needed. RNN needs more work as well. 

IT IS NOT COMPLETE but if anyone wants an idea how to do it, there you are.
